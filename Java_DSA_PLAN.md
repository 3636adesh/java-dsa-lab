# 🧭 5-Month DSA Roadmap (Java Focus)

### 🎯 Purpose
This roadmap is built for a **Java backend developer (3+ years experience)** who wants to close the DSA gap, think algorithmically like an OpenJDK engineer, and enhance backend performance & logic.  
🕒 Recommended time: **2–3 hours/day** for 5 months.

## 📅 Month 1 — Foundations & Arrays-Strings Mastery

**🎯 Goal:** Build a solid problem-solving base & understand how Java handles data structures internally.

**📘 Topics**
- Big O Notation (Time & Space analysis)
- Arrays (rotation, prefix sum, two-pointer, subarray tricks)
- Strings (palindrome, sliding window, frequency map, substring problems)
- Recursion & Backtracking basics
- Java Collections deep dive — `List`, `Set`, `Map` internals

**🧩 Practice**
- 25–30 problems (LeetCode & GFG)
    - *Two Sum, Kadane’s Algorithm, Merge Intervals, Longest Substring, Subarray Sum = K*

**📚 Resources**
- *Data Structures & Algorithms Made Easy in Java* — Narasimha Karumanchi
- *Kunal Kushwaha DSA Playlist* — YouTube

**🏁 Milestone**
> Be able to dry-run and optimize any array or string problem confidently.

## 📅 Month 2 — Linked List, Stack & Queue

**🎯 Goal:** Master pointer logic and understand data flow in memory.

**📘 Topics**
- Linked List — single, double, circular, detect cycle, reverse
- Stack — infix to postfix, min stack, valid parentheses
- Queue & Deque — circular queue, sliding window max
- Understanding `Deque` and `LinkedList` in Java

**🧩 Practice**
- 30 problems: Reverse LL, Detect cycle, LRU cache, Valid parentheses

**📚 Resources**
- [visualgo.net](https://visualgo.net)
- LeetCode Medium problems

**🏁 Milestone**
> Confidently visualize memory references and Java object pointers.

## 📅 Month 3 — Trees, BST & Hashing

**🎯 Goal:** Understand recursion deeply and learn non-linear data structures.

**📘 Topics**
- Binary Tree — DFS, BFS, height, diameter, level order
- BST — insert, search, delete, inorder successor/predecessor
- HashMap & HashSet — internal working, collisions, rehashing
- TreeMap vs HashMap — performance difference

**🧩 Practice**
- 35–40 problems: *LCA, Path Sum, Top View, Pair Sum using HashMap*

**🏁 Milestone**
> Efficiently implement and optimize lookup and traversal-based solutions.

---

## 📅 Month 4 — Graphs, Heaps & Greedy Algorithms

**🎯 Goal:** Strengthen problem decomposition and handle advanced logic.

**📘 Topics**
- Graph representation — adjacency list/matrix
- BFS, DFS, Connected Components
- Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Topological Sort, Union-Find
- PriorityQueue in Java, Heap operations
- Greedy Algorithms — activity selection, interval scheduling

**🧩 Practice**
- 35–40 problems: *Shortest Path, Kruskal’s, Merge K Sorted Lists*

**🏁 Milestone**
> Handle complex real-world algorithmic problems with confidence.

---

## 📅 Month 5 — Dynamic Programming & System Thinking

**🎯 Goal:** Build an algorithmic mindset like R&D engineers.

**📘 Topics**
- DP Fundamentals — recursion, memoization, tabulation
- Classic DP problems — Fibonacci, Knapsack, LIS, LCS
- Sliding Window advanced patterns
- Bitmasking and state transitions

**🧩 Practice**
- 40–45 problems (LeetCode/InterviewBit): Identify overlapping subproblems and optimize

**🏁 Milestone**
> Confident in designing optimal algorithms and recognizing reusable patterns.

## 🧱 Weekly Routine

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Mon–Wed | Learn 1 new concept + solve 3 easy/medium problems |
| Thu–Fri | Solve 2–3 medium/hard problems + review mistakes |
| Sat | Mock test (LeetCode contest or GFG quiz) |
| Sun | Revise notes + write your own summaries |

---

## 🧩 Supplementary Skills (Java-Specific)

- Use **IntelliJ Debugger** to visualize runtime stack and heap.
- Implement data structures manually (LinkedList, Stack, HashMap).
- Explore **java.util.concurrent** (Atomic, Locks, BlockingQueue).
- Connect DSA → backend logic (thread safety, time complexity in APIs).

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome After 5 Months

✅ Solve **150–180 DSA problems** confidently  
✅ Understand **Java data-structure internals**  
✅ Think like a **problem solver & system designer**  
✅ Ready for **OpenJDK-level contributions or product interviews**
